  // React uses virtual DOM elements, which become real DOM elements on a render.
  //  A virtual DOM element can be defined as a simple object literal.
  // Normally you would use the React.createElement() to create an element.
  // This is what the return value of a React.createElement() call could look like.

    // is a React element and not just some user data
    // React.createElement() sets it for you
    $$typeof: magicValue,

    // This will also be checked by React. We will be talking about references
    // later, but if you're not using them, this has to be set to null and not
    // undefined

      children: "Hello, world!",

      style: {
        textAlign: "center",

      // React uses synthetic events, which basically try to normalize browser behaviour
      onClick: function (notYourRegularEvent) { alert("click") },
